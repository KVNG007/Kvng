                  Hi there! My name is David and I enjoy creating things that
                  live on the internet. My interest in web development started
                  back in 2019 during the lockdown when I decided to build and
                  manage my personal blog — Apparently you need proper footing
                  in web development to do that. 😅 Moreover, the experience
                  taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!

                  Fast-forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of interning
                  in a handful of start-ups, and a young but
                  growing corporation. My main focus currently is building
                  accessible financial products at <a href="https://feedxpay.com/" style={{fontWeight: '600'}}>Feedxpay</a>. I am open and actively
                  searching for new opportunities to provide value and advance
                  my career as a web developer. I am open and actively serching
                  for new opportunities to provide value as well as advance my
