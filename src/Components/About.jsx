                        <p>Hi there! My name is David and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. 
                                My interest in web development started back in 2019 during the lockdown when I decided to build and manage my
                                personal blog â€” Apparently you need proper footing in web development to do that. ðŸ˜… Moreover, the experience taught me a lot about HTML & CSS!
                            </p>

                            <p> Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve had the privilege of interning at a few companies, a handful of start-up, and a young but growing corporation.
                                My main focus currently is building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at Lucid Jungles. I am open and actively serching for new
                                opportunities to  provide value as well as advance my career as a web developer.
